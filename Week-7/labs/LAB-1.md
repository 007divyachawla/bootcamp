#Gathering Data
In this lab you will be using the AWS CLI to gather data from your account. Data gathering in the wake of an incident is key to being able to reconstruct the source of the incident. In addition gathering the data will help with being able to reconstruct your application in the new Distaster Recovery (DR) account.


# Gathering Instance Data
Instances information can be gathered using the AWS CLI ec2-describe instances.
