# Bootcamp
Sometimes the best way to learn a new concept is to get directly involved with it.  The DevSecOps Bootcamp is developed by DevSecOps practitioners and inspired by the idea that everyone is responsible for building rugged software, improving security and operating like a boss. 

# Curriculum
You cannot learn the right things to do until you fail a few times.  The DevSecOps Bootcamp is 8 weeks with each week dedicated to a new lesson.  Details: [Curriculum](CURRICULUM.md)
