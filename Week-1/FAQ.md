Q:Regarding attack maps best practices, is there an online resource where we could view different types of attack maps?  I'm especially curious on attacks involving a third-party CDN.

Q: Are there special features in rbenv that we have to use? Can I use RVM?

Q: Can you elaborate on "crawl, walk, run"? Do the different stages refer to how secure our app is (weak->moderate->strong) or does it refer to the different features being added to our app?
